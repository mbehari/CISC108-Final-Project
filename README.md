This repository is used for the final project made by Mischa Behari and Isha Kashif for the course Honors CISC 108 at the University of Delaware.
PITCH & DESCRIPTION: For our game, we plan on displaying photos of different musical notes (those present on musical scales). Users will be able to view an image of a musical note in treble clef form and choose the letter representation of said note. Additionally, there will also be an option for users to practice guessing key signatures -- images will be displayed of certain signatures, and users can press a button representing the associated letter-form of said key signature. Our game utilizes multiple uses of buttons, sheets, and visuals.
Task-List Phase 1 - STEP 1: Make Game Title. STEP 2: Make photos of notes and key signatures appear. STEP 3: Make Introduction/Instructions appear
Task-List Phase 2 - STEP 1: Create 4 buttons for each window. STEP 2: attribute letters to said buttons. STEP 3: add noise in response of correct button being pressed by user. 
Task-List Phase 3 - STEP 1: "Go Back" options/buttons, STEP 2: Add score report, STEP 3: Add colors/aesthetics to game
