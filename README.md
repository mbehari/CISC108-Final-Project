## Pitch and Description
For our game, we plan on displaying photos of different musical notes (those present on musical scales).<br>
Users will be able to view an image of a musical note in treble clef form and choose the letter representation of said note.<br>
Additionally, there will also be an option for users to practice guessing key signatures -- images will be displayed of certain signatures, and users can press a button representing the associated letter-form of said key signature.<br>
Our game utilizes multiple uses of buttons, sheets, and visuals.<br><br>
