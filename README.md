# Musical Madness
This repository is used for the final project made by Mischa Behari and Isha Kashif for the course Honors CISC 108 at the University of Delaware.<br><br>

## Pitch and Description
For our game, we plan on displaying photos of different musical notes (those present on musical scales), allowing users to be able to view an image of a musical note in treble clef form and choose the letter representation of said note.<br>
<br><br>

## About 
In "Musical Madness," a game focused on helping users learn/practice their musical scales knowledge, users will be presented with images of notes on a scale. Users will
be prompted to utilize their keyboards in order to answer the question of "which note/scale is this?" referencing the image shown to the user (for example, if the note shown is A, the user can tap "a" on their keyboard to choose the right answer). The game starts off simple, with generally "easy" questions. After the user gets a score of "10," the questions become harder.
After a user gets a score of "50," more colors and themes are introduced to the game! It is important to note that there is no "winning" or "losing" in the game, as it is solely for the purpose of practicing musical scales knowledge!

## Preview 

## Instructions
The instructions for "Musical Madness" are quite simple, as users only have to utilize their keyboards in order to play the game.
As previously mentioned in the "About" section, if users are shown an image of a note (such as the "b note"), they simply have to tap the "b" key on their keyboard. This rule stays consistent as the game progresses!
